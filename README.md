# 🌙 WitchMart: A Mythic Sanctuary & Marketplace

WitchMart is a community‑driven Pagan marketplace and sanctuary network built for people who have been pushed out of stability, ignored by institutions, or left navigating survival alone.

It provides a stable, accessible, mythic‑structured space where displaced, disabled, and spiritually diverse individuals can find tools, support, and community without gatekeeping or shifting rules.

## 🌌 The Vision

WitchMart exists to replace instability with clarity. It is a place where the rules don’t move depending on who you are or what you have. We are building a cooperative, Pagan‑friendly ecosystem that honors lived experience, accessibility needs, and spiritual diversity.

## 🛡️ Core Principles

- **Accessibility First** — Designed for users navigating disability, trauma, and survival conditions.
- **Radical Stability** — No shifting rules, no hidden requirements, no “prove yourself” barriers.
- **Community‑Owned** — Built by and for the people excluded from traditional systems.
- **Mythic Architecture** — Narrative‑driven design that supports identity, grounding, and belonging.
- **Zero Exploitation** — No data mining, no predatory monetization, and absolutely no surveillance.
